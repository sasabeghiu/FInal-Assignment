                <p>A solar charger gathers energy from your solar panels, and stores it in your batteries.
                    Using the latest, fastest technology, SmartSolar maximises this energy-harvest, driving it
                    intelligently to achieve full charge in the shortest possible time. SmartSolar maintains
                    battery health, extending its life.</p>
                <p>The SmartSolar charge controller will even recharge a severely depleted battery. It can
                    operate with a battery voltage as low as 0 Volts, provided the cells are not permanently
                    sulphated or otherwise damaged. <a href="https://www.victronenergy.com/solar-charge-controllers/smartsolar-100-30-100-50"

                <header><strong>Phoenix Inverter Smart 16600VA-3000VA</strong></header>
                <p>The Phoenix Inverter Smart is an efficient and reliable inverter. Built on our proven and
                    field tested Phoenix inverter platform, it now comes with a new slimmer design and full metal
                    casing.
                    Models are available in 1600VA, 2000VA and 3000VA for 12, 24 or 48V systems.
                    Itâ€™s powerful enough to supply most common plug in appliances in your car, boat, caravan or home.
                    A toroidal transformer provides a high peak power surge capacity, stable voltage, frequency and high
                    quality sine-wave.</p>
                <p>Installation is simpler than ever before with terminals now more accessible for the installer,
                    enabling a more professional finish. Bluetooth is built-in, and makes setting up your high power
                    inverter
                    easier than ever before.Configure alarms, alarm relay, voltage cut-off, output voltage, frequency,
                    eco-mode and more, all from within VictronConnect. <a href="https://www.ikwilzonneenergie.nl/epages/61494231.sf/nl_NL/?ObjectPath=/Shops/61494231/Products/PIN12220000"

                <header><strong>Gel and AGM batteries</strong></header>
                <p>The AGM range has very low internal resistance making them particularly suitable for high current
                    discharge applications such as for inverters, thrusters and winches.</p>
                <p>The GEL model range offers best deep cycle durability and overall longer life. The use of high purity
                    materials and lead calcium grids ensure that for both AGM and GEL products have particularly low
                    self-discharge so that they will not go flat during long periods without charge. Both ranges are
                    supplied with M8 drilled, flat copper terminals ensuring best possible connection contact and
                    eliminating
                    the need for battery terminals. The batteries are compliant with both CE and UL specifications in
                    ABS
                    fireproof containers and come with Victron's 2 year world-wide warranty. <a href="https://www.ikwilzonneenergie.nl/epages/61494231.sf/nl_NL/?ObjectPath=/Shops/61494231/Products/BAT412110081"
