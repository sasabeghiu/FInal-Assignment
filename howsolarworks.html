        <h1>Solar panels</h1>
        <p>Solar panels are made out of photovoltaic cells (which is why generating electricity with solar
            panels is also called solar PV) that convert the sun’s energy into electricity.
            Photovoltaic cells are sandwiched between layers of semi-conducting materials such as silicone.
            Each layer has different electronic properties that energise when hit by photons from sunlight,
            creating an electric field. This is known as the photoelectric effect – and it’s this that creates
            the current needed to produce electricity.
            Solar panels generate a direct current of electricity. This is then passed through an
            inverter to convert it into an alternating current, which can then be funnelled into the
            National Grid or used by the home or business the solar panels are attached to.</p>

        <h1>Charger controller</h1>
        <p>A charge controller is an essential part of nearly all power systems that charge batteries,
            whether the power source are solar panels, wind, hydro, fuel, or the utility grid. Its purpose is
            to keep your deep cycle batteries properly fed and safe for the long term. The basic functions of a
            controller are quite simple. Charge controllers block reverse current and prevent battery overcharge.
            Some controllers also prevent battery overdischarge, protect from electrical overload, and/or display
            battery status and the flow of power. Let's examine each function individually.</p>

        <h1>Battery system</h1>
        <p>A home battery system stores surplus solar power for later use. The solar battery extends the use
            of a PV-system’s generated energy and will provide free, sustainable power even when the sun is not
            shining and the panels don’t produce energy. Therefore, with a solar battery little to no electricity
            is fed into the grid while also avoiding having to buy expensive electricity from the grid later.
            Due to the increased self-consumption, the electricity costs decrease significantly. You will pay
            less per used kWh.</p>

        <h1>DC power</h1>
        <p>The term DC is used to refer to power systems that use only one polarity of voltage or current,
            and to refer to the constant, zero-frequency, or slowly varying local mean value of a voltage or current.
            For example, the voltage across a DC voltage source is constant as is the current through a DC current
            source.
            The DC solution of an electric circuit is the solution where all voltages and currents are constant.
            It can be shown that any stationary voltage or current waveform can be decomposed into a sum of a
            DC component and a zero-mean time-varying component; the DC component is defined to be the expected
            value, or the average value of the voltage or current over all time.</p>

        <h1>Inverter</h1>
        <p>An inverter is a device which converts the DC power in a battery to 240V AC electricity. Inverters
            come in two basic output designs, pure sine wave and modified sine wave (squarewave). Most AC devices
            will work fine on the modified sinewave inverter, but there are some exceptions. Devices such as
            laser printers can be damaged when run on modified sinewave power. Motors and power supplies
            usually run warmer and less efficiently, and some things, like fans, amplifiers, and cheap
            fluorescent lights, give off an audible buzz on modified sinewave power. However, modified sinewave
            inverters make the conversion from DC to AC very efficiently, and they are relatively inexpensive.
            Pure sine wave inverters provide AC power that is virtually identical to, and often cleaner than,
            power from the grid. Inverters are generally rated by the amount of AC power they can supply
            continuously. Manufacturers generally also provide 5 second and 1/2 hour surge figures. The surge
            figures give an idea of how much power can be supplied by the inverter for 5 seconds and 1/2 an
            hour before the inverter's overload protection trips and cuts the power.</p>

        <h1>AC power</h1>
        <p>Alternating current, abbreviation AC, flow of electric charge that periodically reverses.
            It starts, say, from zero, grows to a maximum, decreases to zero, reverses, reaches a maximum in the
            opposite direction, returns again to the original value, and repeats this cycle indefinitely. The
            interval of time between the attainment of a definite value on two successive cycles is called the
            period, the number of cycles or periods per second is the frequency, and the maximum value in either
            direction is the amplitude of the alternating current. Low frequencies, such as 50 and 60 cycles per
            second (hertz), are used for domestic and commercial power, but alternating currents of frequencies
            around 100,000,000 cycles per second (100 megahertz) are used in television and those of several
            thousand megahertz in radar or microwave communication. Cellular telephones operate at frequencies
            of about 1,000 megahertz (1 gigahertz).</p>
